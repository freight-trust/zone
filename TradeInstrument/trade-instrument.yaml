      summary: Query all consignments
      description: >
        Queries for all consignments visible to the user, filtered using the
        criteria below.


        We return up to a maximum of 1000 consignments in one query. Paging is used to retrieve consignments beyond this number. Provide the "newFrom" value from the response body as the "from" parameter to retrieve the next page of results. If "from" is given, all other parameters are ignored, except for "size".


        For the fields listed below, wildcard matching is supported. A '*' can be used in place of one or more characters, and a '?' can replace a single character.

        - exportCountry

        - importCountry

        - entryPort

        - exitPort

        - consignmentId

        - consignmentRef

        - transportEquipmentId

        - transportEquipmentRef

        - harmonizedCode

        - billOfLadingNumber

        - carrierBookingNumber

        - originLocation

        - terminal


        Commodity information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of the correct types, then the following fields will be removed from all consignment response objects, and you will not be allowed to search on these fields:

        - harmonizedCode

        - commodityHarmonizedCode (in the commodities array in bookingData)

        Transport Plan Analysis: This endpoint will return all of the transport plans for the consignment, ordered from most recent to oldest. Each transport plan will include a list of planned events, ordered by the event occurrence time. Together these events indicate the series of locations that each transport equipment, that is associated with the given consignnment, will move on its journey.


        Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment.


        Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport” planned events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment use the …/events/consignmentId/{consignmentId} endpoint.

        Provide the consignmentId of a Consignment. Returns the current progress
        of all transport equipment associated with that consignment. 


        Transport events are divided into three categories: planned, estimated and actual. Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment. Estimated events provide the estimated time things will occur to the transport equipment. Actual events indicate things that occurred to the transport equipment.


        Current Progress Analysis: 

        The current progress will include a list of current progress events, ordered by the sequence in which they occur. Together these events indicate the series of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved, on its journey and everything that happened to it along the way. 

        Each current progress event is made up of a list of actual events, a list of estimated events and the associated planned event.


        Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport” events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment, use the …/events/... endpoint.

      summary: "Get the current progress for a transport equipment "
      description: >
        Provide the transport equipment ID of a transport equipment. Returns the
        current progress of the transport equipment with that ID. 

        Transport events are divided into three categories: planned, estimated and actual. Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment. Estimated events provide the estimated time things will occur to the transport equipment. Actual events indicate things that occurred to the transport equipment.


        Current Progress Analysis: 

        The current progress will include a list of current progress events, ordered by the sequence in which they occur. Together these events indicate the series of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved, on its journey and everything that happened to it along the way. 

        Each current progress event is made up of a list of actual events, a list of estimated events and the associated planned event.


        Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport” events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment, use the …/events/... endpoint.


        Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in each event:

        Originator information:

        In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName' field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred', or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or the org that the document is being transferred to.

Together these events indicate the series of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved, on its journey and everything that happened to it along the way.


        Events are divided into three categories: planned, estimated and actual. Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment. Estimated events provide the estimated time things will occur to the transport equipment. Actual events indicate things that occurred to the transport equipment.


        The event filter parameter can be used to control the processing done in the transport plan analysis.


        * latest -  The transportPlanIssuanceTime8601 will be used to determine the most recent transport plan. All Actual events will be returned, no filtering is done. For Estimated events, the location, the eventSubmissionTime, the originatorId, and the fullStatus fields will be used to determine the most recent version of the event. Estimated events will be replaced by the corresponding Actual events. The resulting list will contain the Planned event (if there is one) followed by the Actual or Estimated (if not Actual).


        * all - All the transport plans sent to this transport equipment will be returned, from most recent to oldest. Each transport plan will have a version, the transport plan issuance date, and the name of the organization that sent the plan, along with the list of Planned events.


        Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport”events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment, use the …/events/... endpoint.


        Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in each event:

        Commodity information:

        - harmonizedCodes

        - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription

        - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode


        Originator information:

        - originatorName

        - originatorId

        - senderOrgId


        In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName' field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred', or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
